## üîß Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fuzzy31u/aipodflow.git
cd aipodflow

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the binary
go build -o podcast-cli ./cmd/podcast-cli
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root or in `$HOME/.aipodflow/` directory:

```yaml
# OpenAI API Configuration (required)
openai_api_key: "your_openai_api_key"

# Art19 Configuration (optional, for publishing)
art19_username: "your_art19_username"
art19_password: "your_art19_password"
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Process a Podcast (Step by Step)

AIPodFlow now supports executing each step of the podcast processing workflow separately, giving you more control over the process:

```bash
# Step 1: Process transcript and call OpenAI API
./podcast-cli process step1 --input-transcript /path/to/transcript.txt --output-dir ./output

# Step 2: Upload title, shownote and audio to Art19
./podcast-cli process step2 --input-audio /path/to/audio.mp3 --content-file ./output/selected_content.txt

# Step 3: Redeploy website on Vercel
./podcast-cli process step3 --dry-run  # Validate configuration without triggering deployment
./podcast-cli process step3            # Trigger actual redeployment

# Step 4: Create text to post to X (not fully implemented yet)
./podcast-cli process step4
```

### Process a Transcript (Legacy Mode)

You can still use the legacy mode to process everything in a single command:

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
./podcast-cli process all --input-transcript /path/to/transcript.txt

# Specify output directory for generated content
./podcast-cli process all --input-transcript /path/to/transcript.txt --output-dir ./output

# Include audio file for Art19 upload
./podcast-cli process all --input-transcript /path/to/transcript.txt --input-audio /path/to/audio.mp3

# Enable verbose logging
./podcast-cli process all --input-transcript /path/to/transcript.txt --verbose
```

### Upload to Art19 with PlayWright MCP

PlayWright MCP enables automated uploading of episodes to the Art19 platform using browser automation. Make sure you have Node.js and PlayWright installed:

```bash
npm install -g playwright
playwright install
```

To upload an episode to Art19 via PlayWright MCP:

```bash
node scripts/art19_upload_title.js --audio /path/to/audio.mp3 --title "Episode Title" --show-notes /path/to/shownotes.txt
```

This script will launch a browser, log in to Art19, and upload your episode automatically.

## ü§ñ PlayWright MCP & Art19 Upload

### What is PlayWright MCP?
PlayWright MCP (Multi-Channel Publisher) is a Node.js-based automation tool that uses PlayWright to perform browser operations for podcast management. In AIPodFlow, it is used to automate the process of uploading podcast episodes and metadata to the Art19 platform, reducing manual steps and improving reliability.

### How It Works
- Automates browser actions for logging in, filling forms, and uploading files to Art19
- Can be extended to support other platforms with similar workflows

### Usage Example
See the [Usage](#usage) section above for a sample command.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

AIPodFlow is built with a modular architecture:

- **CLI Layer**: Handles user input and command execution
- **Processor Layer**: Manages the content generation workflow
- **Service Layer**: Integrates with external APIs (OpenAI, Art19)
- **UI Layer**: Provides interactive selection interface
- **Model Layer**: Defines data structures for content processing

### Integrations

- OpenAI API for content generation
- Various podcast hosting platforms (Art19, Spotify, etc.)
- PlayWright for browser-based automation (Art19 upload)
- Vercel for website deployment
- Twitter/X API for social media distribution

### Key Components

- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o for high-quality content generation
- **Art19 API**: Enables direct upload of podcast content
- **Interactive UI**: Terminal-based interface for content selection

## üß™ Development

The project uses:

- Go 1.21+
- Cobra for CLI commands
- Logrus for structured logging
- Viper for configuration management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
